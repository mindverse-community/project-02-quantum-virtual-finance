# 💹 Quantum Virtual Finance (QVF)

**Quantum Virtual Finance (QVF)** is a quantum-graph-based algorithmic trading framework that transforms financial market data into a quantum event space and learns phase-based strategies using reinforcement learning.

- 🧩 Nodes = market events (price momentum, volume shifts, volatility spikes)
- 🔗 Edges = phase relationships between indicators across instruments and time
- 🧠 RL Agent = operates on quantum harmonics of the market graph
- 📉 Trading = emergent decisions from collapse points in graph resonance
- 📊 Output = trades, confidence tensors, phase-shifted alpha signals
