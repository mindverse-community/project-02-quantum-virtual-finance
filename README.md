# 💹 Quantum Virtual Finance (QVF)

**Quantum Virtual Finance (QVF)** is an advanced algorithmic trading platform that reimagines financial markets as **quantum graphs**. In this framework, market dynamics are represented as **phase-coupled event networks**, and trading strategies are derived by analyzing the **harmonic structure and bifurcations** within this evolving graph.

## 🌌 Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧩 Nodes | Financial events (price movements, volatility shifts, volume spikes) |
| 🔗 Edges | Phase-based relationships across time and instruments |
| 🧠 RL Agent | Learns to trade based on harmonics and phase collapse dynamics |
| 🎼 Market Graph Harmonics | Oscillatory modes that indicate potential regime shifts |
| 📊 MST (Market State Tensor) | Captures and tracks the system-wide coherence |

## 📈 Applications

* Trading futures, crypto, and FX using phase-coherent signals
* Market regime detection based on graph spectral shifts
* Risk-aware position sizing using MST entropy
* Alpha signal refinement through harmonic alignment
* Adaptive RL agents that align to market attractor basins
